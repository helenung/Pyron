					<h3>Lower Willamette Passive Sampling for Remedial Alternative Evaluation, Portland, OR.</h3>
					<h4>January 2014 – Present</h4>
					<p>This study is requested by the Lower Willamette Superfund Site PRPs under the EPA Region 10 oversight to conduct a sampling and analysis of PCB congeners, using the passive PE sampling techniques, to evaluate the PCB loading via sediment porewater at various sites in the Lower Willamette River. Mr. Lin is the senior project chemist for the project, responsible for assisting in determining proper sampling and analysis protocols for the project, developing the QAPP, coordinate and oversee the laboratory performance, and performing a QC review on sampler preparation and handling compliance and a Stage 4 data validation on analytical data.</p>

					<h3>Kimberly Clark Everett Mill Pre-RI, Interim Action and RI Soil and Groundwater Sampling, Bellingham, WA.</h3>
					<h4>2011 – Present</h4>
					<p>This site investigation program was under WA Department of Ecology’s close oversight and public monitoring. Hundreds of soil and groundwater samples were collected during various phases of the investigation and remediation activities. Samples were analyzed for dioxins/furans, VOCs, SVOCs, PAHs, Pesticides, PCBs, metals, low-level mercury, TPH-Gasoline, and TPH-Diesel/Oil. Mr. Lin has been assigned as the senior project chemist for the program responsible for developing the phase-specific QAPPs, laboratory requirement setup and oversight, addressing Ecology’s comments during and post sampling and analysis, TPH fuel fingerprinting, performing Level 3 validation on dioxins/furans and PCB congeners data and Level 2b validation on all remaining data.</p>

					<h3>Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), NPDES Stormwater Monitoring Program, Olympia, WA.</h3>
					<h4>June 2012 – Present</h4>
					<p>Mr. Lin is retained by the WSDOT as the program on-call data quality consultant. Upon the request by the WSDOT, Mr. Lin has developed the Quality Management Plan (QMP) for the monitoring program, along with supplemental protocols such as Field and Analytical Data Flow Control, Laboratory Data Package Specifications, and Data Validation Criteria and Procedures. Mr. Lin is responsible for performing a Level 4 validation on 10 percent of the data collected during each monitoring year to identify any laboratory-related reporting errors or system anomalies. For each monitoring year, Mr. Lin performs an overall data quality assessment to identify any systematic QC issues relative to field operations, laboratory procedures, and/or data management and provide recommendations to resolve identified issues.</p>

					<h3>City of Seattle Lower Duwamish Waterway Slip 4 Source Tracing Sediment Sampling, Seattle, WA.</h3>
					<h4>2003 – Present</h4>
					<p>The monitoring program is governed by the Clean Water Act. Sampling and analysis procedures follow USEPA, Washington Department of Ecology, and Puget Sound Estuary Program (PSEP) protocols. Approximately 200 sediment samples are collected per year for contaminant source control studies. All samples are analyzed for semi-volatile organic compounds, PCBs, metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, and TOC. All data are validated according to the USEPA CLP National Functional Guidelines and PSEP requirements. Nr. Lin has been performing the QAPP revision, chemical data quality validation, and data usability determination for the program since 2003.</p>

					<h3>Port of Seattle Aviation Division, Phase I Municipal Stormwater Monitoring, Seattle, WA.</h3>
					<h4>2009 – December 2013</h4>
					<p>The monitoring program complies with provisions under 40CFR and Washington State Administration Codes (WAC) for municipal stormwater quality monitoring. Mr. Lin performed QAPP revisions, chemical data validation (Level 3/4 for dioxins and Level 2b for all remaining analyses), and final data usability determination on all analytical data submitted by the contracted laboratory in 2009, 2011, and 2012. The QC measures performed by Mr. Lin ensured the legal defensibility of collected data, and provide a scientifically-sound foundation for decision making on stormwater diversion and management for the Port of Seattle.</p>
